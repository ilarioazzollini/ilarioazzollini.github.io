# 1 - Education

## 1.1 - PhD in Control Systems Engineering
#### _University of Bologna (Italy), Nov 2018 -- Oct 2021_

- PhD Program in Biomedical, Electrical and System Engineering ([link](https://phd.unibo.it/ibes/en))
- _Thesis_: "Robust Adaptive Control with Applications to Multi-Agent Systems and Mobile Robotics" ([link](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/10244/))
- _Main topics_: Nonlinear and Adaptive Control, Distributed Control Systems, Hybrid Systems, Output Regulation, Nonlinear Optimization, Input-to-State-Stability, Robust Least-Squares Estimation, Robust Estimation and Control for Mobile Robotics applications (Quadcopters for Search & Rescue applications, and Rovers for agricultural applications)
- _Awarded_ with the Marco Polo Program Scholarship: economic support to promote research periods abroad for young researchers working at the department
- _Visiting PhD Student_ at Imperial College London's [Control and Power Research Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/control-and-power/) from March 2021 to August 2021 (fully remote unfortunately). I worked on adaptive stabilization and control of nonminimum-phase systems, uniform complete observability, (extended) high-gain observers and their applications to nonlinear stabilization problems.
- _Contributor for the European Project AirBorne_ (AerIal RoBotic technologies for professiOnal seaRch aNd rescuE) as a systems and control research engineer. My contribution consisted in the development of control algorithms able to drive the ARVA-equipped drone(s) as close as possible to the victim(s), in a robust way ([link](https://www.airborne-project.eu/)).
- At the end of my PhD career (November 2021), I had a 5 h-index on google scholar with 53 total citations, with 3 journal papers and 8 conference papers already published (some other were still under review at the time).

## 1.2 - MSc in Systems and Control
#### _TU Delft (The Netherlands), Sep 2016 -- Oct 2018_
#### _Grade: Cum Laude (GPA: 8.8/10)_

- _Thesis_: "Adaptive Synchronization over Uncertain Multi-Agent Systems: A distributed homogenization-based approach"
- _Main topics_: Control Theory, Optimization, Filtering and Identification, Digital Control, Robust and Multivariable Control, Nonlinear Control, Adaptive and Predictive Control, Networked and Distributed Control. For all these courses, several projects were successfully developed in Matlab/Simulink.

## 1.3 - BSc in Automation Engineering
#### _University of Bologna (Italy), Sep 2012 -- Jul 2016_
#### _Grade: 106/110_
