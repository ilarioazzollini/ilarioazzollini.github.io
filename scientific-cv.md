# 1 - Education

## 1.1 - PhD in Control Systems Engineering
#### _University of Bologna (Italy), Nov 2018 -- Oct 2021_

- __Thesis__: "Robust Adaptive Control with Applications to Multi-Agent Systems and Mobile Robotics" ([thesis link](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/10244/), [presentation link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzxerce4gbonlc0/PhD_final_presentation.pdf?dl=0))
- PhD Program in Biomedical, Electrical and System Engineering. Curriculum: Automatic Control and Operational Research (Control Systems Engineering) ([link](https://phd.unibo.it/ibes/en))
- __Main topics__: Nonlinear and Adaptive Control, Distributed Control Systems, Hybrid Systems, Output Regulation, Nonlinear Optimization, Input-to-State-Stability, Robust Least-Squares Estimation, Robust Estimation and Control for Mobile Robotics applications (Quadcopters for Search & Rescue applications, and Rovers for agricultural applications)
- _Visiting PhD Student_ at __Imperial College London__'s [Control and Power Research Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/control-and-power/) from March 2021 to August 2021 (fully remote unfortunately). I worked on adaptive stabilization and control of nonminimum-phase systems, uniform complete observability, (extended) high-gain observers and their applications to nonlinear stabilization problems.
- _Contributor for the European Project AirBorne_ (AerIal RoBotic technologies for professiOnal seaRch aNd rescuE): contributed to the development of control algorithms able to drive the ARVA-equipped drone(s) as close as possible to the victim(s), in a robust way ([link](https://www.airborne-project.eu/)).
- At the end of my PhD career (November 1, 2021), I had a 5 h-index on google scholar with 53 total citations, with 3 journal papers and 8 conference papers already published (some other were still under review at the time).

## 1.2 - MSc in Systems and Control
#### _TU Delft (The Netherlands), Sep 2016 -- Oct 2018_
#### _Grade: Cum Laude (GPA: 8.8/10)_

- __Thesis__: "Adaptive Synchronization over Uncertain Multi-Agent Systems: A distributed homogenization-based approach" ([thesis link](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Aa93dbba3-4a78-4c6e-bdb3-8cb954911a70), [presentation link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vpqqovb7zngvpjy/MSc_Final_Presentation.pdf?dl=0))
- __Main topics__: Control Theory, Optimization, Filtering and Identification, Digital Control, Robust and Multivariable Control, Nonlinear Control, Adaptive and Predictive Control, Networked and Distributed Control.
- As part of my thesis, I published and presented my first two conference papers at ECC18 in Cyprus. See [C1] and [C2] in [Publications](#22---conferences).

## 1.3 - BSc in Automation Engineering
#### _University of Bologna (Italy), Sep 2012 -- Jul 2016_
#### _Grade: 106/110_

- __Thesis__: "Analysis of Lead-Acid batteries with a third-order dynamical model" ([thesis link](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/10961/), [presentation link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/syi57reuc8loj4v/BSc_final_presentation.pptx?dl=0))
- __Main topics__: Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Automatic Control, Electrical Circuits, Electronics, Computer Architectures, Control Systems Technologies, Electric Drives, Robotics.
- __AlmaTong__ exchange project: I attended the second year at the __Tongji University of Shanghai__, together with the chinese students participating in the project. The courses and exams were given in english, both during the second here and during the third year (back in Bologna)
- The last part of my thesis was done in the frame of a collaboration with [Amplio Energy Europe](http://amplioenergy.com/index.html).
- As part of my thesis, I published my first journal paper on the Transactions on Power Systems. See [J1] in [Publications](#2---publications).
