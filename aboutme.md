Hi! My name is Ilario Antonio Azzollini and since November 2021 I am working as an _R&D Automation & Robotics Software Engineer_ at the [SACMI Innovation Lab](https://www.sacmi.it/en-us/Corporate/Innovation/Sacmi-Innovation-Lab). In particular, I work in the automation and simulation software team. In line with my background studies, I mainly work on the development and testing of novel control algorithms. 

My work can be usually decomposed in the following subtasks:
* mathematical system modeling (if not provided/already developed)
* identification of the system parameters (data/experiment-driven if necessary)
* stability/observability/controllability analysis of the system
* (robust) control algorithm development (as complex as it needs to be, or... as simple as it can possibly be!)
* software development inside a useful simulation environment (the right tool for the job) where I can then also perform optimization (of trajectories and/or some parameters of interest)

## My story

I was born in Puglia (Italy), but I've almost always lived in a small town near Bologna. I enjoy learning new stuff, travelling, playing tennis, and going out with friends and family.

I hold a BSc in [Automation Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/AutomationEngineering) from University of Bologna, during which I also spent a whole year in Shanghai, at Tongji University, as part of the [AlmaTong](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/AutomationEngineering/opportunities-multiple-degree-programme) project.

After that, I moved to the [Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control) for my MSc in [Systems and Control](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/systems-control/msc-systems-control).

Then, I came back to Bologna for my PhD studies in Automatica, that is part of the [IBES](https://phd.unibo.it/ibes/en/phd-programme) programme. I have been accepted to the final defence that should grant me the title at the end of June 2022.

I got married in September 2021, while in November 2021 I left academia and started working as an _R&D Automation & Robotics Software Engineer_ at [SACMI](https://www.sacmi.it/en-us/).
