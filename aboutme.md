Hello there! I'm Ilario, welcome to my personal website!

This is the place where I would like to share and write about my free-time activities and projects. I am passionate about _systems and control engineering_, _robotics_, and _software development_ in general. I am eager to learn new stuff, and to contribute to the open-source community in the process.

Let me shortly introduce myself. If you are curious and want to have a deeper understanding in my education background, you could visit my [Scientific CV](https://ilarioazzollini.github.io/scientific-cv/) page.

I was born in Puglia (Italy) in 1992, but I've almost always lived in a small town near Bologna (since 2001). I enjoy learning new stuff, travelling, playing tennis, playing videogames, and going out with friends and family.

I hold a BSc in [Automation Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/AutomationEngineering) from University of Bologna (2012-2016), during which I also spent a whole year in Shanghai, at Tongji University, as part of the [AlmaTong](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/AutomationEngineering/opportunities-multiple-degree-programme) project.

After that, I moved to the [Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control) for my MSc in [Systems and Control](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/systems-control/msc-systems-control) (2016-2018).

Then, I came back to Bologna for my PhD studies in Control Systems Engineering (2018-2021), that is part of the [IBES](https://phd.unibo.it/ibes/en/phd-programme) programme. I officially received the degree in June 2022.

I got married in September 2021, while in November 2021 I started working as a _R&D Software Engineer_ at [SACMI](https://www.sacmi.it/en-us/).
