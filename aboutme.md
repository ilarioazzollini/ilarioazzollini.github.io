I’m a Mobile Robotics Researcher and Software Engineer with a PhD in Control Systems Engineering. At my core, I'm passionate about solving complex problems, especially when the solution requires diving deep into technical/mathematical concepts and pushing beyond existing approaches.

My current work at [E80 Group](https://www.e80group.com/en/) centers on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). I contribute both to research projects and to the development and maintenance of core localization libraries that enable robots to operate autonomously 24/7. My experience spans the full robotics lifecycle: design docs, software development, lab testing, on-site prototype deployment, and production-ready systems.

Equally important to me is the craft of software engineering. I’m passionate about writing clean, reliable code, designing robust software architectures, and building systems that last. Testing, documentation, and continuous integration aren’t just boxes to tick. I strongly believe they are practices that ensure impact at scale. My main coding languages are C++ and Python, but I like experimenting and learning new ones (like Rust atm). I believe in the importance of open-source software for advancing research, in particular I am a supporter of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2.

While I enjoy being an individual contributor, I also thrive as a technical lead. In that capacity, I define technical direction, break down complex problems into achievable milestones, set success metrics, and ensure the team is aligned on priorities. Mentoring is central to my leadership style: through code reviews, system design discussions, and one-on-one guidance, I aim to help others grow technically while also considering their long-term development and interests.

Ultimately, my work is about delivering impact through software—building systems that matter, supporting teams to succeed, and continuously learning along the way.
